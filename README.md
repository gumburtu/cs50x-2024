Number Guessing Game

This is my cs50x 2024 final project. This is a number guessing game. 
You have 10 guesses and there are 3 different difficulty levels. 
If you guess the number with less than 10 tries, you will see a congratulations message. 
If you try to enter a number outside the difficulty levels you selected, you will see a warning message.
I have combined all the codes on one page for practicality. 
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript in the production of the game and received support from artificial intelligence applications.

Enjoy.
