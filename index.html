                <h2>How to Play:</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! Here’s how you can play:</p>
                <p>Select a Difficulty Level:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easy:</strong> Guess a number between 1 and 10. You have 3 guesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Guess a number between 1 and 100. You have 5 guesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard:</strong> Guess a number between 1 and 1000. You have 10 guesses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Guessing Rules:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter a number in the input field and click "Submit Guess".</li>
                    <li>If your guess is correct and you have guesses left, you will see a "Congratulations!" message.</li>
                    <li>If you use all your guesses without finding the correct number, you will see a "Game Over" message.</li>
                    <li>The game will alert you if you enter a number that you have already guessed. Please try a different number.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Previous Guesses:</strong> The game keeps track of all your previous guesses to ensure you do not repeat any.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duplicate Guesses:</strong> If you enter a number that you’ve already guessed, the game will warn you and ask you to enter a different number.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Good luck, and have fun!</strong></p>
